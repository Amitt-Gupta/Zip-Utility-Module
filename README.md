# Objective:
This module provides two Java actions for handling file compression in Mendix:
1. ZipFiles: Compresses multiple FileDocument objects into a single ZIP file.
2. UnzipFile: Extracts the contents of a ZIP file into individual FileDocument objects.
Useful for scenarios involving file packaging, uploads, and downloads within Mendix apps.
# Dependencies:
Studio Pro Version: 10.12.10
# Configurations:
1. Import the Zip Utility Module from the Mendix Marketplace.
2. Drag and drop the ZipFiles or UnzipFile Java actions into a microflow.
3. Pass the required parameters (e.g., a list of FileDocument objects for zipping, or a ZIP FileDocument for unzipping) to complete the action.
